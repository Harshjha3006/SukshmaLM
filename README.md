# SukshmaLM 

A small-scale LLM built for educational purposes. <br>
<b>Currently, only code for the tokenizer is provided. Rest components will be pushed soon</b>.<br> 
I have used a BPE tokenizer, which supports multiple special tokens, custom vocabulary size, and custom training data. <br>
Description of the tokenizer and instructions to use it are given at [tokenizer/README.md](tokenizer/README.md)
